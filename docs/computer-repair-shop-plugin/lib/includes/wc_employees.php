				A customer looking into your website services, and Parts area, will have an option to select add to cart the cart widget is available in premiume version so wherever you add the widget the ordered service or part would be added into that cart and user can then order more services or parts during that time. So once a user is done with all order he would go to cart page where he will see his total of parts and services if a service is ordered then part installation charges would not apply also if any service enabled pick up and delivery and its charges that would be added in extras to cart page only 1 time. Similar if a service say laptop rental available for week or 1 days charges would be added once in extras on cart page, where user can modify that means if he dont want to get any of these both extra services he/she can just delete them and order other service.

			Employees also have option to start a job which come in jobs so employee start working on that job and then send it to next employee changing the status of job for customer to get Email and view by entering to his account by loging in. Login details would be emailed to customer during his job creation. Employee can only see the jobs he created or someone else assigned him. Once he assign job to someone else he would not able to make any change into that job unless its assigned back to him. Admin can do all things anytime. But the employee would able to see list of jobs in specefic period he started or he did.

	<p>When a job is assigned to an employee by admin or if he created job himself or the job was ordered from the cart system by client, employee will start working on job and if he install a part in job he will select part from parts list. Same for services then he will assign job to other employee or mark system as done. Which would be informed to admin users and client by Email.</p>
