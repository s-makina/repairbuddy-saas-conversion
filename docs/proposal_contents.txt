PROJECT PROPOSAL: RepairBuddy SaaS Conversion 
Project: WordPress Plugin to Standalone SaaS Platform 
Proposed Timeline: 8 Weeks (Phase 1 – Core Platform) 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
This proposal outlines the transformation of the RepairBuddy WordPress plugin into a 
standalone, multi-tenant SaaS platform. By decoupling from WordPress, the system will achieve 
improved performance, scalability, and long-term maintainability, enabling reliable growth and 
easier future expansion. 
The objective of this phase is to deliver a production-ready core SaaS platform with all essential 
functionality required for real-world usage, including multi-tenancy, repair workflows, billing 
readiness, and operational stability. The system will be built with a clear foundation for future 
enhancements and additional modules. 
TARGET ARCHITECTURE 
The recommended architecture is designed to ensure security, scalability, and long-term 
maintainability: 
• Backend: Laravel 11 (Modern PHP) 
• Frontend: React 18 (Single Page Application) 
• Database: PostgreSQL 
This stack enables strong tenant-level data isolation, consistent performance, and clean 
separation of concerns. The architecture is provider-agnostic and suitable for deployment across 
multiple hosting environments. 
Note: The proposed timeline and cost assume timely feedback, clear requirements, and no major 
scope expansion during the development phase.

PAYMENT STRUCTURE 
To ensure steady progress, quality delivery, and uninterrupted development, payments are 
aligned with milestone completion. 
Payment Terms: Each milestone is payable upon successful delivery and verification against the 
agreed acceptance criteria. This structure ensures clear visibility into progress, shared 
accountability, and consistent development momentum throughout the project lifecycle. 
BUDGET ALIGNMENT 
To ensure the scope and delivery approach remain aligned with your expectations, I would be 
happy to understand if you have an anticipated budget range or maximum planned expenditure 
for this phase. This will allow fine-tuning of priorities while ensuring the best possible value is 
delivered within the agreed investment. 
I’m flexible and open to discussion, particularly given the opportunity for long-term 
collaboration across multiple projects. 
STABILIZATION & FUTURE PHASES 
The project includes final stabilization activities such as: 
• Bug fixes and refinements 
• Performance tuning 
• Deployment readiness checks 
Future phases may include: 
• Advanced reporting and analytics 
• Mobile applications 
• Third-party integrations 
These enhancements can be planned and scoped separately once Phase 1 is complete. 
NEXT STEPS 
1. Confirm approval of the proposed scope, timeline, and budget 
2. Finalize milestone start dates and communication cadence 
3. Commence development with Milestone 1
